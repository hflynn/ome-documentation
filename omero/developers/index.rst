installation and administering OMERO can be found under the
:doc:`/sysadmins/index` of the main site.

**OMERO** is an open source client/server system written in Java for
visualizing, managing, and annotating microscope images and metadata.
The |OmeroApi| allows clients to be
written in :doc:`Java </developers/Java>`, :doc:`Python </developers/Python>`,
:doc:`C++ </developers/Cpp>` or :doc:`MATLAB </developers/Matlab>`. OMERO
releases include a Java client OMERO.insight, a Python-based web client
OMERO.web and the :doc:`/developers/cli/index`, which also uses
Python. There is also an ImageJ plugin. OMERO can be extended by modifying
these clients or by writing your own in any of the supported languages (see
figure). OMERO also supports a :doc:`Scripting Service <scripts/index>` which
allows Python scripts to be run on the server and called from any of the other
clients.

OMERO is designed, developed and released by the |OME|, with contributions
from |Glencoe| OMERO is released under the `GNU General Public License (GPL)`_
with commercial licenses and customization available from |Glencoe|. You can
read about how OMERO has developed since the project started in the
:doc:`/users/history`.

Insight

.. note:: With the release of OMERO 5.3.0, the OMERO.insight desktop client
    has entered **maintenance mode**, meaning it will only be updated if a
    major bug is discovered. Instead, the OME team will be focusing on
    developing the web clients. As a result, coding against this client is no
    longer recommended.
